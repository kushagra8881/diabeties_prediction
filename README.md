# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Project repository! This project focuses on creating a robust machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals. By utilizing a diverse set of features including Pregnancies, Glucose levels, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin levels, BMI (Body Mass Index), Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age, we aim to achieve an impressive prediction accuracy of up to 90%.

## Project Goals

- Develop a high-accuracy machine learning model for diabetes prediction.
- Compare and contrast the performance of different algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
- Provide insights into feature importance and their impact on prediction.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- `models/`: Saved model files for each algorithm after training.
- `src/`: Python source code files with utility functions and preprocessing scripts.
- `README.md`: You are currently reading this file, which offers an overview of the project.
